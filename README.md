# **Ranked Practice**
### A Minecraft 1.16.1 mod that simulates MCSR Ranked solo Private Rooms
Ranked Practice lets you practice speedruns with filtered seeds that are similar to the ones found in MCSR Ranked.
Things like **guaranteed enters** (lava pool / magma ravine), **boosted piglin trades**, **guaranteed loot in bastion**, etc. are all meant to be **exactly the same** as Ranked.
